# CI pipeline and two-slot development

The repository uses narrow, opt-in local feedback and exact-head public
certification. GitHub Actions is the ordinary broad-test and merge authority.
The workflow never requires a visible browser.

## Two development slots

Keep at most two substantive branches active:

- Slot A is pushed and undergoing pull-request certification.
- Slot B is a separate worktree containing the next independent rules batch.

Create Slot B from current remote `main` while Slot A is running:

```powershell
git fetch origin --prune
git worktree add ..\quorune-next -b <next-branch> origin/main
Set-Location ..\quorune-next
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e . -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Never rebase or rewrite Slot A while its exact head is being certified. If its
CI fails, preserve coherent Slot B work, fix Slot A in its own worktree, push a
new immutable head, and let stale runs cancel. After Slot A merges, fetch and
rebase Slot B only when its changes actually overlap the merged work.

Clean up a merged slot only after confirming its pull request and `main` SHA:

```powershell
git fetch origin --prune
git worktree remove <merged-worktree-path>
git branch -d <merged-branch>
git push origin --delete <merged-branch>
```

Do not delete a branch with unique work, an active run, or an unmerged pull
request.

## Local impact inspection

Do not run broad local suites as the ordinary workflow. If feedback is
materially useful, run only the exact new test and smallest adjacent impacted
selection. Before push, inspect what CI will select:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/quick_gate.py --dry-run
```

`platform/change-impact-policy.json` is the versioned many-to-many path/check
policy consumed by `scripts/change_impact.py`, `scripts/quick_gate.py`, and
`scripts/ci_plan.py`. It maps normalized paths to the manifest in
`platform/test-shards.json`, generated checks, and platform gates. Internal
rules modules are never classified by generic words such as `action` or
`choice`; browser-facing protocol, projection, action-catalog, choice-form,
server, lifecycle, and persistence paths are explicit. `engine.py` and
`session.py` no longer imply every browser journey by path alone: the typed
subsystem changed alongside them selects any focused public behavior. A
compiler-only change with no browser-facing runtime or schema change therefore
keeps the compact smoke only. For responsibilities still inside the legacy
engine, the planner maps changed Python hunks in both the base and candidate
trees to qualified function owners. Changes to the enumerated priority, yield,
and action-opportunity methods require complete browser E2E; unrelated engine
orchestration does not inherit that cost. Cross-cutting protection and
attachment sources deliberately select compiler, replacement, targeting, and
state-action owners so a source-correctness regression cannot escape through a
single narrow shard. When explicitly executed for diagnosis,
`scripts/quick_gate.py` includes
committed and working-tree changes, validates Python 3.12, compiles Python,
builds the compact card database when necessary, runs directly changed tests
and affected functional shards, and selects relevant generated, architecture,
rules, repository, package, or browser-build checks.

The local quick gate does not run Playwright journeys. Browser-sensitive work
gets generated-type, typecheck, and production-build checks locally; isolated
headless Chromium belongs to CI. Never add a command that opens, focuses, or
navigates the user's browser.

## Generated artifact finalization

`platform/generated-artifacts.json` is the canonical ownership and dependency
manifest for deterministic Python reports enforced by generated/architecture
CI. It does not replace the existing owners for protocol types, pinned rules
snapshots, or other separately governed generated assets. It declares each
registered output, its writer and checker, and whether writing is automatic,
database-backed, or a deliberate manual baseline operation. CI and the local
impact plan invoke the same interface. Run write mode after the coherent
source/test/documentation worktree is complete and before the final commit;
inspect and stage its outputs with the source change:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\finalize_generated.py --write
```

Compiler, capability, CardProgram, and card-support changes require the pinned
database census in the same finalization run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\finalize_generated.py --write --db data\scryfall-current.sqlite3
```

Write mode runs generators in topological order and repeats only changed
generators and their downstream automatic or derived-only consumers until a
bounded pass changes nothing. A requested database-backed corpus rebuild occurs
only on the first pass because the DAG already orders all of its consumers
afterward. It then runs all freshness checks, documentation validation, and
diff hygiene. Pass `--db <path>` or set
`MTG_CARD_DB` when a card-data-backed frontier or full reusable-piece rebuild is
required. The manifest owns the full/Commander Oracle and CardProgram census
before the card-unlock frontier, so the frontier cannot compare current source
against stale status counts. The reusable-piece writer can refresh
architecture-derived delta metadata without rebuilding the pinned corpus.
Performance baselines remain
manual because observed latency is review evidence, not an automatic rewrite.
Use `--check` for read-only diagnosis and in CI; a successful `--write` already
performs that verification, so do not run both commands consecutively.

Install the tracked pre-push hook once in each worktree:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\install_dev_hooks.py
```

The installer sets the local `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks` and refuses to
overwrite another hook policy. The hook is a backstop that uses the
worktree-local Python. It first runs `scripts/test_shards.py validate`, because
an unassigned discovered test module makes PR planning fail before any matrix
job can run. It then automatically uses `data/scryfall-current.sqlite3` when
present (or `MTG_CARD_DB` when set), runs generated write mode, and rejects the
push when generated outputs need a commit. It never amends a commit.
Pull-request CI remains check-only and authoritative.

The full `scripts/local_merge_gate.py` is not a default development step. Run a
broad local gate only when the user explicitly asks or while diagnosing a
CI-only/release-critical persistence, replay, privacy, or packaging failure.
Otherwise push the coherent exact head and use the CI window for independent
Slot B work.

## Pull-request certification

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these independent jobs:

- ten balanced Ubuntu functional shards;
- canonical generated-artifact finalization checks from the ownership
  manifest, followed by rules, documentation, repository, and architecture
  validation;
- wheel build and clean-install verification;
- a focused Windows compatibility overlay for ordinary changes;
- for platform-sensitive changes or the `windows-full` label, all eleven
  authoritative primary shards on isolated Windows runners and Python
  processes, with `fail-fast: false`, at most five concurrent workers,
  per-shard compact databases and runtime roots, and no shared writable state;
- one separate Windows wheel build and clean-install verification, followed by
  `PR / Windows Certification`, which fails closed on the wrong mode, missing,
  skipped, failed, duplicate, or zero-test shard results, a manifest partition
  gap, or package failure;
- browser build plus a compact authoritative four-context lifecycle smoke;
- focused `mana-action`, `combat`, or `turn-draw` Playwright journeys selected
  by the affected typed rules owner (or the matching `browser-*` label);
- three deterministic complete Playwright groups for browser, protocol, projection,
  reconnect, room, WebSocket, lifecycle, persistence, browser-facing choice or
  action schema changes, workflow changes, natural-winner critical rules, or
  the `browser-full` label. The nonempty `lifecycle`, `rules`, and `soak`
  groups use distinct ports, runtime directories, and SQLite databases.

The compact smoke is the bounded reconnect/lifecycle journey: it starts the
real server, creates four seat-isolated tabs, validates private hands, submits
accepted mulligan commands including an exact retry, survives pause/resume and
reconnect, and closes every context. It does not play a natural game to a
winner. Natural completion remains in the `soak` group and runs when browser,
persistence, replay, Commander-damage, combat-completion, state-based-loss, or
workflow ownership changes. Focused journey tags are closed policy values in
`platform/change-impact-policy.json`; adding an arbitrary test title cannot
silently expand or bypass the gate.

The final `PR / Certification` job receives the stable Windows certification
result and every other required job through `needs`, and fails unless all
succeeded. Protect `main` with the exact required status context
`PR / Certification`. After verifying those dependencies, the job publishes an
untracked `exact-head-certification-<run-id>` artifact. Its strict receipt pins
the repository, pull request, exact PR-head SHA, workflow run, complete required
check suite, fingerprint algorithm, and tracked source-tree fingerprint. It
does not contain or predict the eventual merge SHA.

The pre-sharding public baseline is run `31025126367`: its single Windows
discovery process executed the complete test allocation in 2,265.245 seconds
(37 minutes, 45.245 seconds) before reporting the already-corrected
generated-audit drift.
Use the exact-head matrix metrics—not that historical total—to decide whether
the five-runner ceiling or shard allocation should change.

Do not use `gh pr merge --auto` until branch protection is confirmed. Without a
required check, GitHub may merge immediately while jobs are still running.
Once protection is active, auto-merge is safe only for the immutable SHA whose
certification is in progress.

The nonblocking metrics job records observed queue, job, step, and critical-path
durations plus Playwright journey duration, status, retries, failure class,
browser-context count, accepted command count, authoritative/projected
revisions, and measured persistence/review time. It also reports each Windows
shard's queue, setup, test and total duration, executed test count, the one-time
package duration, the Windows critical path, and actual overlapping test-runner
concurrency. Raw JSON reports and the combined `ci-metrics` artifact are
retained for 14 days so future shard changes use measured history. Cache-hit
rate, agent idle time, and stale-run cancellation remain `null` when GitHub
does not expose measured data; the reporting code never estimates them as
observations.

Long browser journeys use one shared progress driver rather than nested timeout
loops. It observes the decision ID, phase/step, active and priority players,
view/state revisions, accepted command and event counts, latest event, actor
queue, and pending persistence. Ninety seconds without a real change fails with
a compact snapshot and exact one-test rerun command. Ordinary command
acknowledgements still wait for authoritative durability, while review artifacts
remain derived and are generated only for paused or terminal records.

`platform/readiness-source.json` contains durable product and certification
policy only. Pull-request numbers, exact heads, workflow runs, merge SHAs,
runtime branches, and transient integration chronology belong to GitHub and the
untracked certification receipt. The generated readiness report fingerprints
its actual source, package, stable test-shard inventory, rules, and CardProgram
inputs. Exact tracked-source equivalence belongs only to the certification
receipt and main-smoke verification. Environment-sensitive executed-test totals
remain CI metrics rather than tracked readiness state.

Deterministic failures that escape the quick gate are recorded in
`platform/ci-escape-source.json`. The generated
`coverage/ci-escape-report.json` and `.md` classify each failure, its direct
regression, and the impact-edge disposition. Push counts and Slot B idle time
remain null when they cannot be observed; workflow-run counts are not relabeled
as pushes.

## Main and nightly assurance

`.github/workflows/main-smoke.yml` runs after each push to `main`. It checks a
compact replay/server suite, generated integration state, pinned rules, wheel
metadata, and the production browser build. It is an integration alarm, not a
second complete pre-merge suite. Before those checks, it resolves the pull
request associated with the current merge commit, finds a successful PR workflow
for that exact head, downloads its live certification receipt, and requires the
current tracked source tree to have the same fingerprint. A squash merge passes
without a follow-up status commit because commit identity is deliberately not
the equivalence boundary; a materially different tree, missing/stale receipt,
failed gate, direct push, or mismatched GitHub coordinate fails closed.

`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` owns expensive breadth:

- complete deterministic Python suites on Ubuntu and Windows;
- all three isolated headless Chromium groups, including the natural-winner
  soak;
- at least 100,000 deterministic property transitions across parallel jobs;
- focused implementation mutations, natural-winner/persistence soak, and
  performance/repository checks;
- current Scryfall ingestion and full/Commander Oracle and CardProgram
  censuses as artifacts;
- Python and npm dependency audits.

Nightly failures are real regressions or assurance debt. Fix them on a focused
branch; do not weaken the nightly budget to make a failure disappear.

## Headless browser commands

The public workflow is authoritative, but a focused local reproduction may be
run headlessly after assigning isolated paths and ports. None of these commands
opens a visible browser or HTML report:

```powershell
$env:MTG_CARD_DB = "data/test-ci-smoke.sqlite3"
$env:MTG_E2E_SERVER_PORT = "18081"
$env:MTG_E2E_WEB_PORT = "15171"
$env:MTG_E2E_RUNTIME_DIR = "../local/playwright-smoke"
$env:MTG_PLAYWRIGHT_JSON = "../local/playwright-smoke.json"
npm run e2e:smoke --prefix web

Set-Location web
npx playwright test --grep "@browser-lifecycle"
npx playwright test --grep "@browser-rules"
npx playwright test --grep "@browser-soak"
```

Use different database, runtime, and port values when groups run concurrently.
On failure, prefer the exact `--grep` command printed by the progress diagnostic.

## Shard maintenance

Every `tests/test_*.py` module belongs to exactly one primary shard in
`platform/test-shards.json`. Overlay suites such as `main-smoke`,
`windows-compat`, and `nightly-property` may intentionally reuse modules.

Before the final commit and push, validate ownership after adding, renaming, or
deleting a test module:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/test_shards.py validate
```

Every primary shard is directly reproducible on Windows and can write the same
compact result record consumed by public certification and metrics:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/test_shards.py run core-domain `
  --result-json local/windows-results/core-domain.json
```

`generated-validation` is a primary shard, not a second full-discovery pass.
The complete Windows matrix therefore executes every discovered test module
exactly once. `windows-compat` remains an intentionally overlapping focused
suite and never runs alongside the full matrix.

Keep functional shard weights close enough to use parallel capacity. Split by
coherent subsystem ownership, not by individual test methods. The generated
inventory shard is separate because thousands of small generated cases have a
different runtime profile from behavioral tests.

## Recovery and inspection

Inspect current repository activity without opening a browser:

```powershell
gh pr list --state open --limit 50
gh run list --limit 20
gh run view <run-id> --json status,conclusion,headSha,url
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | {name,status,conclusion}'
```

If the stable certification context is missing, first inspect the workflow job
graph and `scripts/verify_ci_needs.py`. If the quick gate selects an unexpected
surface, add a deterministic classifier regression before changing the mapping.
Never bypass a failing required check or represent unavailable CI metrics as
observed values.
