# ADR 0034: intrinsic entry counters use the replacement tree

## Context

Planeswalkers and Battles enter with loyalty or defense counters because of
CR 306.5b and 310.4b. The previous engine initialized those counters after a
zone move by writing the permanent's counter map directly. That bypassed
CR 614.16 replacement ordering, could not suspend for competing replacements,
and gave compilation no fine-grained declaration for behavior derived from a
card's type line rather than its Oracle text.

## Decision

Compile an immutable card-form declaration from the canonical parsed type set
and printed nonnegative integral loyalty or defense value. The declaration is
source-spanned against the exact type line and requires
`counter.producer.intrinsic_entry`; it is not represented as Oracle text and is
not reparsed at runtime.

At entry preparation, lower the declaration to a mandatory self-replacement on
the containing `zone.change` event. Applying it creates a typed nested
`counter.place` event. Zone-destination replacements may retarget that child,
then the canonical counter-placement transaction performs affected-controller
ordering, suspension, commit, projection, and replay. Resolution stores a
strict `resolving_entry` continuation and resumes the same stack item without
reapplying already completed effects.

Tokens are created directly on the battlefield rather than moved there. The
token owner therefore reserves immutable prospective token refs, object IDs,
logical identities, and one entry timestamp before mutation. It resolves the
complete additional-token replacement prefix and then one simultaneous typed
intrinsic-counter batch against those prospective objects. Any second
replacement choice suspends through the same strict effect selection journal.
Only after both replacement families finish does the owner allocate the exact
reserved identities, commit the tokens, and apply the prepared counters.

The engine remains the high-level transaction facade. It does not own a second
counter write or a second replacement implementation.

## Alternatives

- Initialize counters after entry. Rejected because it bypasses replacement
  ordering and cannot roll back or suspend atomically.
- Encode the rule as synthetic Oracle text. Rejected because type-line and
  Oracle-text provenance are different authorities.
- Add Planeswalker- and Battle-specific branches to counter mutation. Rejected
  because the shared typed counter event already owns replacement and commit.

## Consequences

- Ordinary card entry, simultaneous APNAP preparation, competing quantity
  replacements, seat-scoped choices, and exact replay share one event tree.
- Printed values reject missing, boolean, fractional, negative, and malformed
  data before mutation.
- Siege protector selection remains a separate entry choice. Unsupported
  Battle subtypes fail closed.
- Planeswalker and Battle tokens use the same counter-placement replacement
  owner. Additional-token and counter-quantity choices resume sequentially
  without duplicating either transformation or exposing the continuation to
  another seat.
- Loyalty costs, counter removal or movement, Saga lore actions, and broader
  optional, variable, state-derived token creation, copy, face-down, and
  continuous-characteristic interactions remain outside this decision.
- Game Record v3 and public protocol schemas remain unchanged; compiler,
  capability, and continuation fingerprints advance.

## Removal condition

Replace this boundary only with a typed entry transaction that preserves
card-form provenance, self-replacement ordering, nested counter events,
identity-pinned suspension, authoritative mutation ownership, privacy, and
exact replay.
