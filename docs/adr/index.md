# Architecture decision records

ADRs are immutable decision history. Supersede an accepted ADR with a new one;
do not rewrite its outcome. Use the [template](template.md) for decisions that
change dependencies, persistence, CardProgram/compiler schemas, runtime
extension interfaces, mutation ownership, replay, ruleset pinning, trust,
deployment modes, or architecture review thresholds.
