# Rules dependency queue

Source fingerprint: `892a1c885516cd38a34dbad127b6a13b94ccfbdabfdc00e17be3d3255966995f`

## Current top-level state

- Pinned rules: `3300`
- Queued rules: `2945`
- Subsystems: `21`
- Selected subsystem: `replacement-prevention`
- Selected batch: `counter-producer-replacement-closure`

## Top blockers

- Inventory every represented permanent- and player-counter producer and identify which paths still bypass the canonical counter-placement owner.
- Route one coherent reusable producer family through the immutable resumable counter-placement transaction without adding direct GameState writes.
- Preserve cost timing, entry timing, simultaneous APNAP ordering, rollback, privacy, and exact replay for migrated producers.
- Add generic CardProgram lowering and precise source spans where the migrated family originates in Oracle text.
- Add focused positive, negative, interaction, multiplayer, rollback, replay, and killed implementation-mutation evidence for the migrated boundary.

Complete rule, subsystem, dependency, classification, and selected-batch data is in the [machine-readable rules queue](../coverage/rules-dependency-queue.json).
