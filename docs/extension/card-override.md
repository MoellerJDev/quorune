# Card override extension guide

A card override is a last-resort, reviewed program for behavior that cannot yet
be expressed by reusable compiler nodes and capabilities. It belongs in
metadata/override scope, never as a printed-name or Oracle-ID branch in the
kernel.

An override is a CardProgram V2 producer, not a parallel runtime format. It
must emit the same typed ability fields and exact fingerprints as generated or
reviewed pack input. `simctl card overrides` lists only programs with explicit
override metadata; ordinary reviewed semantic packs are not silently relabeled
as typed overrides.

## Required evidence

1. Record the exact Oracle ID, Oracle text hash, rulings hash, rules snapshot,
   semantic schema, and compiler version.
2. Classify every material compiler residual and explain why a reusable node is
   not yet appropriate.
3. Declare zones, timing, targets, costs, choices, events, replacements,
   visibility, replay behavior, and capability dependencies.
4. Add positive, negative, rollback, replay, projection/privacy, and relevant
   interaction tests.
5. Add a removal plan that names the generic capability or compiler family that
   will supersede the override.

An override with a stale source fingerprint is unavailable, not approximately
valid. A third substantially similar override must generalize the common
pattern or carry an ADR explaining why it cannot. The identity-flow guard
inventories an override only through its exact reviewed module classification;
there is no card-data-derived generic exemption or prohibited-flow allowance.
